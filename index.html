Most smart TVs come with the Netflix app pre-installed, allowing you to stream directly on your television. If you prefer, you can also use streaming devices like Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, or Google Chromecast, all of which support Netflix. For gamers, Netflix is available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles. On the go, you can watch Netflix on your smartphone or tablet by downloading the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>To cancel your Netflix subscription, start by logging into your account on the Netflix website or app. Navigate to the "Account" section by clicking on your profile icon or selecting "More" in the app, then choose "Account" from the dropdown menu. In the "Membership & Billing" section, you'll find the "Cancel Membership" option. Click on it and follow the prompts to confirm your cancellation. Netflix will ask if you're sure about canceling and will inform you of the end date of your service, which typically coincides with the end of your current billing cycle. Once you've completed the process, you'll receive a confirmation email. If you're billed through a third-party service like iTunes, Google Play, or your cable provider, you'll need to cancel through that service. After cancellation, you'll still have access to Netflix until the end of your billing period.</p>
